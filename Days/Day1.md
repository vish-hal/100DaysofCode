The instructor just touch the surface of course and try to tell why is it worth it and what you will be learning.

#### How to get most out of the course

It's where **Dr. anglena Yu** have discussed about how you should go through course some major tips tips are as below

- Make sure to code with instructor.

[12 Rules to Learn to Code](https://att-b.udemycdn.com/2018-11-27_16-22-59-6713554884ef40b6c176a23c545e8394/original.pdf?secure=qYr5ae_RvapZTBegxL4bRw%3D%3D%2C1618068003&filename=12+Rules+to+Learn+to+Code+eBook+%5BUpdated+26.11.18%5D.pdf)

This is quite usefull for a newbie like me, As this could help in coming  up with better approach on how to write code .purpose and also some myth we need to overcome have discussed here. Great work have been done here by **Dr. anglena Yu** .

#### How does internet work
```
Client --> ISP --> DNS Server
DNS Server (ip) --> ISP --> Client 
Client --> ISP --> via internet backbone --> Server
Server (return requested files) -->> via inernet backbone --> ISP --> Client
```
When Client entered domain name for the server then ISP take that request and DNS Server make a domain name search and find corresponding IP address of the Server. DNS server then returned the Requested IP address to Client via ISP. Then client made another request to the server IP via using ISP and internet backbone for the resources. Server then Returned the requested resources via internet backbone and ISP to Client.

You can also check the total time it took in this process by pressing F12 in your browser and then tap on network tab here you have to see the Time column where response time for each resource is mantioned.

#### How does a website work

I get to know  How a standard website is build

 **HTML**  ``` -->``` **Structure**
 **CSS** ```-->``` **Styling**
 **JavaScript** ```-->``` **Functionality/Responsiveness**

 It's means that  **HTML** is used for providing web pages a basic structure.  **CSS** is used to make the page content look good .It makes website Stylish.**JavaScript**  provides **Functionality/Responsiveness** to website or you can say the expected behaviour website need to perform when specific action is done by Web Client.
