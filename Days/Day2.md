So it's Day 2 and today i got introduced to HTML and some of it's elements.

Started with creating a first page of well known book **The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes**

Where i got to introduced to 
```html
<h1> heading tags</h1
<center> align resource to center </center>
```
#### The Anatomy of  HTML tag

The **HTML** tags are basically of 2 types 

1. Self Closing tag
2. rest of them

##### Self closing tags

Sometimes also refered as stand alone tag as these must not require end tag just start tag is enogh for them to work properly. 
```html
<hr>
<br>
<img src="" alt="" >
```

##### Other tags

all the other tag which require both tag start & end tag can be considered in this category. 

```html
<p>paragraph tag</p>
<html></html>
<head></head>
<title> </title>
<body> </body>
```

##### Attributes

Attributes are nothing but the additional information about the HTML element.

```html
<a href="url/path">name of hypertext</a>
 <!--here href is attribute of a or anchor tag-->
```
##### Comments in HTML

In HTML you can not make single like comment by type # or // you will have write like this.
```html
<!--something to be commented is here --> 
```

Then we learn How can we see how website used to look in past using [waybackurl](web.archieve.org) website.

```html
<!Doctype HTML>
<!--it indicate that it's a HTML version 5 document which affect How browser handle the page information-->
<!-- UTF charset declaration is important becaue other wise you browser could show you mojibake-->
```
Then i learn how can we use emoji and see the whole list of suppported character in UTF encoding  at [unicode-table.com](unicode-table.com)


After that  got to know why we should prefer 
```html
<em></em> and <strong></strong> tag insted of <i></i> and <b></b>
for SEO.
```


##### List

There are two type of lists in HTML ordered list and unordered list. Sytex is as below for both lists.

```html
<ul>
<li>unorderedlist item </li>
<li>unordered list item</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>ordered list item</li>
<li>ordered list irem</li>
</ol>

```

Lastly i learned about img tag  how alt text also used for seo as well. Got to know about a site where you could crop image online in circle shape [https://crop-circle.imageonline.co/](https://crop-circle.imageonline.co/) and also about anchor tag and it is used to link web pages.
